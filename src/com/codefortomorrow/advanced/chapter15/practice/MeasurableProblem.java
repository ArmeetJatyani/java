/*
Create a Measurable interface
that is used to “measure” anything. Add necessary methods.
Required Methods: double average(Measurable[] items),
largest(Measurable[] items) or smallest(Measurable[] items).
Create a Student class that implements Measurable and
it’s methods(you can compare whatever you measure, i.e. GPA).
Note: for the largest/smallest methods don’t worry
about the case if they are equal.
