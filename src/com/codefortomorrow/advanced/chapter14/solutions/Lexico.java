/*
Practice: Use File I/O to compare two files lexicographically.
Lexicographical order is very similar to alphabetical order,
except that it includes more than just lowercase alphabets.
Given two text files f1 and f2, write a program that will
compare their contents and output to the console the
title of the file which comes first lexicographically.

Hint: Javaâ€™s String.compareTo method may be of use to you.
