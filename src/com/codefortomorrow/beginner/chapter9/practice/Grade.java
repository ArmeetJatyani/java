 * Create a program called Grade

 * the number of test scores to be
 * entered and then prompts the user
 * to enter those scores.
 *
 * Then your program should print
 * the letter grades that correspond
 * to each score. (Use a char[] array
 * to store the letter grades.)
 *
 * Sample output:
 *
 * Enter the number of test scores: 5
 * Enter score 1: 3
 * Enter score 2: 61
 * Enter score 3: 100
 * Enter score 4: 87
 * Enter score 5: 75
 *
 * Grades:
 * F D A B C
