/*
 * Create a program called Billing which
 * prompts the user for the number of items
 * they will enter. Then ask the user for
 * the name of the item and price repeatedly.
 * Once the last item and its price has been
 * entered, print a receipt which has each item
 * and its price, as well as the subtotal, tax,
 * and total. (The sales tax rate is 8%.)
 * Hint: Use an array to store the item names and prices.
 *
 * Sample output:
 * Enter the number of items: 3
 * Enter item #1: shirt
 * Enter price of item #1: $15.43
 * Enter item #2: pants
 * Enter price of item #2: $12.38
 * Enter item #3: hat
 * Enter price of item #3: $4.99
 *
 * RECEIPT
 * --------------------------------------
 * shirt - $15.43
 * pants - $12.38
 * hat - $4.99
 * --------------------------------------
 * Subtotal: $32.80
 * Tax:      $2.62
 * Total:    $35.42
 *
 * Hint: You may encounter a problem when using Scanner.
