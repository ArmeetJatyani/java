/*
 * Create a program called VirusStats
 * which takes user input for a country
 * and type of statistic and displays the
 * statistic asked for. The program should
 * end whenever the user enters "quit".
 *
 * Use separate 1D arrays for the type of stats,
 * countries, capitals, population, number of cases,
 * deaths, recoveries, death rates, recovery rates,
 * infection rates, and "risk grade." (Please note that
 * "risk grades" are not based on actual scientific
 * fact and were made up for the purposes of this exercise.)
 *
 * The data you need can be found here:
 * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XZ0GjALsu2mhraGMJoj37jTmy_S2sw51FFMeywqkcnw/edit?usp=sharing
 *
 * To calculate the death rate:
 * Take that country's deaths and divide it by the number of cases.
 *
 * To calculate the recovery rate:
 * Take that country's number of recoveries and divide it
 * by the number of cases.
 *
 * To calculate the infection rate:
 * Take that country's number of cases and divide it
 * by the population.
 *
 * For the rates: Bonus points if you can round them (or format them)
 * to the nearest hundredths place.
 *
 * To determine the "risk grade", where 'A' is most dangerous
 * and 'F' is least dangerous:
 *
 * 'A' if infection rate > 0.25 OR death rate > 25
 * 'B' if infection rate > 0.2 OR death rate > 15
 * 'C' if infection rate > 0.15 OR death rate > 10
 * 'D' if infection rate > 0.1 OR death rate > 5
 * 'F' for all else
