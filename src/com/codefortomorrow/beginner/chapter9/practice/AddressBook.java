/*
 * Create a program called AddressBook
 * which prompts the user to enter
 * 5 addresses.
 *
 * The program should prompt the user
 * for the house number (int), street (String),
 * apartment (char), and zip code (int).
 *
 * Note that there is no nextChar() method
 * in the Scanner class, so you will need to do
 * something like this:
 * Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
 * char apt = input.nextLine().charAt(0);
 *
 * It should then print each of the addresses. If
 * the user entered '-' for the apartment, the apartment
 * should not be printed (see sample output).
 *
 * The zip codes should always be printed so that
 * they are 5 digits long. (You may need to use
 * String formatting so that if the zip code
 * is not 5 digits, it will fill in 0s to the left
 * of the number until the entire zip code is 5 digits
 * long. You can read about that here:
 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/473282/how-can-i-pad-an-integer-with-zeros-on-the-left)
 *
 * Sample output: https://youtu.be/ms2tM-llTwo
