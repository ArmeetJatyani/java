/*
 * Create a program called Calculator which has
 * the same functionality as the one in the switch
 * example, except with more features!
 *
 * Here's where we're going to make use of the
 * modulus operator which gives the remainder of
 * a division problem. Add the % operator as one
 * possible option for the user to choose and utilize.
 *
 * You should also change the operator choices.
 * For example, instead of prompting the user for
 * "add" or "subtract", prompt them for the characters
 * '+' and '-'. Note: You can assume that the operator
 * given by the user is the first character in the line,
 * since there is no nextChar() method for Scanner.
