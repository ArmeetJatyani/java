/*
 * Write a program called CountAverage
 * that reads an unspecified number of integers,
 * determines how many positive and negative
 * values have been read, and computes the
 * total and average of the input values (not
 * counting zeros). Your program ends with the input 0.
 * Display the average as a decimal. You can assume
 * that the user will enter at least 1 non-zero number.
 *
 * Sample output:
 * Enter integers separated by spaces. Input ends if it is 0: 1 2 -1 3 0
 * The number of positives is 3
 * The number of negatives is 1
 * The total is 5
 * The average is 1.25
 *
 * Adapted from Exercise 5.1 from
 * Introduction to Java Programming (Comprehensive), 10th ed.
