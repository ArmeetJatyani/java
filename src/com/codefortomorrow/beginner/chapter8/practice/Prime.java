/*
 * Create a program called Prime
 * which prompts the user to enter the
 * number of prime numbers they wish to
 * have displayed (let this be numberOfPrimes).
 * Then display the first numberOfPrimes prime
 * numbers such that there are 10 primes
 * displayed per line.
 *
 * Sample output:
 *
 * Enter the number of primes you want to print: 15
 * The first 15 prime numbers are
 *
 * 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29
 * 31 37 41 43 47
 *
 * Note: An integer is prime if it is greater than
 * 1 and its only positive divisor is 1 or itself.
 * For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime, but
 * 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not.
 *
 * Hint: This problem is difficult and requires
 * you to solve multiple problems. The key to this
 * is to break it down into the following tasks:
 *
 * - Determine whether a given number is prime
 * - For number = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ... , etc., test whether it is prime
 * - Count the prime numbers (so that you can print 10 on each line)
 * - Display each prime number, and display 10 numbers per line
 *
 * We highly recommend that for this problem, you plan out
 * your program rather than writing it out by scratch right out
 * of the gate. Programmers often do this with a technique called
 * pseudocode, where you write your program out with comments
 * in regular English about what you plan to do.
 *
 * Adapted from Listing 5.15 PrimeNumber.java from
 * Introduction to Java Programming, 10th ed.
