 * Create a class called FactorialFor
 * which takes an integer >= 0 and
 * prints the factorial of that integer.
 * (The factorial of 4 is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.
 * Factorial is denoted with an exclamation point,
 * like so: 4! = 24.)
 * You should use a for loop to calculate the factorial.
 *
 * Sample output:
 * Enter an integer: 5
 * 5! = 120
