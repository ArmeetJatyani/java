 * Create a program called Drive.
 * In the main method, do the following:
 * - Prompt the user to enter their age
 * - Create 3 boolean expressions isMinor,
 *   isAdult, and isSenior. A person is
 *   a minor if they're under 18. They are
 *   an adult if they're 18-64 years old.
 *   They are a senior if they're 65+.
 * - Use the boolean expressions to print
 *   the age group the user is in.
 * - Use the boolean expressions to print
 *   whether the user can drive. An adult
 *   or senior can drive, while a minor cannot.
