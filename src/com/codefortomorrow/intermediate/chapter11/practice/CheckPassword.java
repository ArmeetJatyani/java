/*
Some websites impose certain rules for passwords.
Write a method that checks whether a string is a valid password.

Suppose the password rules are as follows:
■ A password must have at least eight characters.
■ A password consists of only letters and digits.
■ A password must contain at least two digits.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a password and displays
Valid Password if the rules are followed or Invalid Password otherwise.
To do this, use a method called isValid which returns true if the password
is valid and false otherwise.

You may also find it helpful to write a method called
isAlphanumeric which returns true if the given string
is only made up of letters and digits.

You may also find it helpful to write a method called
getNumberOfDigits which returns the number of digits
in a given string.

You may also find it helpful to use the Character.isDigit(char)
and Character.isDigit(char) methods. You can read more about them here:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_characters.htm

If you don't want to use those methods, you can also use regular
expressions (aka regex) and the matches(regex) String method.
You can read about that here:

Bonus points for writing JavaDoc comments for the methods.
