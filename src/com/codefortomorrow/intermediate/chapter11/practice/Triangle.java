/*
Create a class named Triangle that contains the following two methods:

Return true if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
(This is the definition of a valid triangle.)
public static boolean isValid(double side1, double side2, double side3)

Return the area of the triangle.
public static double area(double side1, double side2, double side3)

Write a test program that reads three sides for a triangle
and computes the area if the sides form a valid triangle.
Otherwise, it displays that the input is invalid.
Use Heron's Formula to calculate the area of a triangle given 3 sides:
