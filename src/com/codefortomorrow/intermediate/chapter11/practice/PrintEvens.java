Code a method printEvens that takes an integer parameter n.
The method should print the first n even numbers to the console.
(Note that 0 is considered an even number.)

Test if your printEvens method works in the main method
by calling it at least 3 times with different arguments.

Bonus points if you write a JavaDoc comment
for the printEvens method.
