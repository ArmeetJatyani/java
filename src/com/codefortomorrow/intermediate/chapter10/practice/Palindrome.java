/*
Create a class called Palindrome.
In the main method, prompt the user to
enter a word. Then print whether the word
given is a palindrome.

Note: Your program should disregard all
leading and trailing whitespace, and should
be case insensitive.

Example output 1:

Enter a word:     RaCecAr
The word is a palindrome.

Example output 2:

Enter a word: hello
The word is NOT a palindrome.
