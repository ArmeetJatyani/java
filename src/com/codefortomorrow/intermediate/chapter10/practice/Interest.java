/*
Write a program called Interest, which calculates the
final amount in an account which earns interest that
is compounded continuously. (Donâ€™t worry about what
this means, just use the formula A = Pe^(rt) to calculate it,
where A is the final amount, P is the principal or initial
amount, r is the annual interest rate as a decimal, and t
is the time in years.)

In the main method, prompt the user to enter the principal,
annual interest rate (as a decimal), and period of time (in years).
Then, print the final amount based on those values.

Use String formatting (you can use String.format() or
System.out.printf() for this) to make sure that only
2 decimals are displayed. Bonus points if you can also
use formatting to include commas for large numbers
(for example, try to display $1,000.00 instead of $1000.00).

public class Interest {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
