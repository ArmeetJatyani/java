 * Create a driver class called TestSelectionSort

 * an array and the elements (doubles) in the array.
 * Then, your program should use selection sort to
 * sort the array in place, and then print the resulting array.
 *
 * Example output:
 *
 * Enter the length of the array: 5
 * Enter the elements in the array: -1 236.3 2 6 0
 * -1.0 0.0 2.0 6.0 236.3
