		/* Fill a 4 X 6 integer array with 24 random values from 7 to 77. 
Print the values in 4 rows of 6 elements.
Using the same array, keep track of the sum of all the values in the array.  Display the sum on its own line under the values.
Keep track of the maximum and minimum value in the array.  Display the max and min on the line below the sum.

Fill a 3 X 3 string array so that the values in each row are “*”, “**”, “***”.	
Print the values in 3 rows of 3 elements, each separated by a tab. 
Fill the array in a loop, with a separate variable that will keep track of the number of asterisks in each term.

Fill a 5 X 4 integer array according to the following pattern:

4	9	16	25	
8	27	64	125
16	81	256	625
32	243	1024	3125
64	729	4096	15625
 
Print the values in 5 rows of 4 elements.
Use nested loops to fill the values into the array, rather than just declaring the values initially.
*hint*: You can set the values of the first row. (You will then need a loop to print the first row separately from the rest of the array.) */
